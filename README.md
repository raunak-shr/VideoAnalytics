# Video Analytics with YOLO

This project focuses on utilizing the YOLO (You Only Look Once) object detection algorithm for video analytics. YOLO is a state-of-the-art, real-time object detection system that can detect multiple objects within images and videos swiftly and accurately.

## Overview

This project leverages Python along with the YOLO algorithm to analyze videos, detect objects within them, and perform various analytics tasks. It provides functionalities such as:

- Object detection within video streams.
- Tracking of objects across frames.
- Counting and logging of detected objects.
- Integration with other analytics systems.
- Customizable configuration options for different use cases.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- YOLO (You Only Look Once) algorithm implementation
- OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision Library)
- Additional libraries as specified in the requirements.txt file
