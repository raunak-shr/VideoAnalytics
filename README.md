# Video Analytics with YOLOv8

This project focuses on utilizing the YOLO (You Only Look Once) object detection algorithm for video analytics. YOLO is 
a state-of-the-art, real-time object detection system that can detect multiple objects within images 
and videos swiftly and accurately.

## Overview

This project leverages Python along with the YOLO algorithm to analyze videos, detect objects within them, 
and perform various analytics tasks. It provides functionalities such as Accident (implemented)
detection within video streams and saves the frames to a database (locally in the backend server as of now).

## Requirements

- Python 3.10
- YOLOv8 (You Only Look Once)from Ultralytics
- Additional libraries as specified in the requirements.txt file
